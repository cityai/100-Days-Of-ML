# 100 Days of Machine Learning Roadmap

Welcome to the 100 Days of Machine Learning Challenge! This roadmap will guide you through 100 days of learning and practicing machine learning concepts and techniques. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience in machine learning, this challenge will help you solidify your understanding, build your skills, and work on real-world projects.

## Goal

The goal of this challenge is to dedicate at least an hour every day for 100 days to study, practice, and apply machine learning concepts. By the end of the challenge, you should have a strong foundation in machine learning and be able to apply it to real-world problems.

## How to Participate

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the [100-Days-Of-ML](https://github.com/swalehmwadime/100-Days-Of-ML) repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Update the README**: Make sure to update the README file in your forked repository with your progress, resources, and any additional notes you find helpful.

3. **Commitment**: Commit to studying machine learning for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. 

4. **Share Your Progress**: Share your progress on social media using the hashtag #100DaysOfML to connect with other participants and stay accountable.

5. **Stay Consistent**: Consistency is key. Even on busy days, try to dedicate some time to learning and practicing machine learning.
