# 100 Days of ML Roadmap

Welcome to the 100 Days of ML Roadmap! This documentation serves as a guide to help you navigate your journey through machine learning over the course of 100 days. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this roadmap will provide you with a structured plan to enhance your skills and knowledge in the field of machine learning.

## Overview

The roadmap is divided into three phases: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each phase spans approximately 30 days and focuses on different aspects of machine learning, gradually progressing from foundational concepts to advanced topics.

## Beginner Phase (Days 1-30)

### Days 1-10: Introduction to Machine Learning Basics

- Learn the fundamentals of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Understand key concepts such as training data, features, labels, models, and algorithms.
- Explore popular ML libraries and frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

### Days 11-20: Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Master techniques for data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights from datasets using visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn.
- Learn how to preprocess different types of data, including numerical, categorical, and text data.

### Days 21-30: Supervised Learning Algorithms

- Dive deep into supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
- Understand the principles behind each algorithm and learn how to implement them using Python.
- Explore advanced topics like ensemble methods (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting) and model evaluation techniques.

## Intermediate Phase (Days 31-70)

### Days 31-40: Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

- Study unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering (k-means, hierarchical clustering) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE).
- Learn how to apply these algorithms to real-world datasets for tasks like customer segmentation and anomaly detection.
- Experiment with different clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to understand their strengths and limitations.

### Days 41-50: Deep Learning Fundamentals

- Delve into deep learning concepts, including artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
- Explore popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and learn how to build deep learning models from scratch.
- Work on projects involving image classification, natural language processing (NLP), and time series prediction using deep learning techniques.

### Days 51-60: Advanced Deep Learning Techniques

- Explore advanced topics in deep learning, such as transfer learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and reinforcement learning.
- Understand how to apply these techniques to solve complex problems in domains like computer vision, NLP, and robotics.
- Dive into research papers and online courses to gain a deeper understanding of cutting-edge deep learning methods.

## Advanced Phase (Days 71-100)

### Days 71-80: Specialized Topics in Machine Learning

- Choose a specialization within machine learning, such as computer vision, NLP, reinforcement learning, or generative modeling.
- Dive deeper into specialized topics relevant to your chosen domain, and explore advanced research papers and online resources.
- Work on projects that showcase your expertise in your chosen specialization and contribute to the advancement of the field.

### Days 81-90: Real-World Applications and Case Studies

- Explore real-world applications of machine learning in industries such as healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and autonomous vehicles.
- Study case studies and success stories of companies leveraging machine learning to solve complex problems and drive innovation.
- Gain insights into the challenges and opportunities of implementing machine learning solutions in practical settings.
